### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an education professional who is currently completing a bootcamp in coding and data science.

I'm interested in using using machine learning to extract information from data. In the finalCapstone respository you can find my final capstone project, using Unsupervised Machine Learning.

I'm also interested in Python development and developing coding solutions to problems.
